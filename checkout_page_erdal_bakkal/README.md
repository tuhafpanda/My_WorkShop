Pre-note: This work is tribute to a fiction character of a famous TV Show. All UI elements are named in local but actual code tags are in English.

HTML and CSS files are created to simulate a pre-check out acknowledgement page of an e-commerce website. 

JS DOM events are used to propagate product increase/decrese and removal steps as well as the price calculations.

Browser's local storage was added to store some basic variables.
